# InternDev-Task-3
Exploratory Data Analysis

🔍 Key Steps:

1️⃣ Explored dataset structure with .info(), .describe(), and checked for missing values.

2️⃣ Visualized distributions of numerical variables like Age, Income, and Miles using histograms.

3️⃣ Analyzed categorical variables (Product, Gender, Marital Status) with count plots.

4️⃣ Encoded categorical columns for seamless analysis.

5️⃣ Highlighted relationships:

Scatter plot: Income vs. Miles by Product

Boxplot: Income distribution by Product

Pairplot to explore trends across variables.

6️⃣ Built a Correlation Matrix to identify strong relationships.

7️⃣ Used boxplots to detect outliers in numerical columns.

8️⃣ Created a new feature: Miles_per_Dollar and visualized its distribution.

This analysis emphasizes the power of data visualization in uncovering trends and insights. 🌟

📈 Libraries Used: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

💡 Takeaway: Combining statistical summaries and visualizations enhances dataset understanding and sets the stage for further analysis.
